Right from my school life in Kolkata, I have been actively working on various Java technologies and at the end of first year, I also did a training under IBM on various Java technologies and cloud computing. By second year, the hacking bug bit me mainly to access Wifi of restricted places with poor security. I did a course under ISOEH (Indian School of Ethical Hacking) under Ethical Hacking to further enhance my knowledge. In third year, I got an Internship in Amazon India and was put in the Supply Chain Optimisation Technologies (SCOT) team. My main job was to make a software to calculate the amount of influx of goods (using Machine Learning Techniques) and how much they needed to keep in their warehouses along with a robust notification service for the same. All the work basically involved Java. I also got exposed to Spring framework and due to rigorous testing procedures, I got familiar with almost all testing frameworks from Mockito, to PowerMock and EasyMock which is essential for robust software. I also got exposed to a lot of open source frameworks developed by Amazon and due to my satisfactory performance, I was offered a PPO (pre-placement offer) by Amazon India.

I am investigating molecular, cellular, and genetic changes that occur in schizophrenia. I received my master's degree at the University of New Hampshire in neuroscience where I became proficient at basic molecular biology techniques as well as the organization, perseverance, and attention to detail necessary to complete scientific experiments. I find every aspect of science exciting, whether it be sorting through the literature and brainstorming ideas, forming and refining experimental protocols, analyzing data, or interpreting and presenting results. In this regard, I value the team effort that is necessary for scientific advancement, but also feel very comfortable in an independent role. As a graduate student in neuroscience, I conducted independent research, managed a colony of transgenic mice, trained and supervised undergraduate students in the lab, and worked as a teaching assistant for both neuroscience and virology lab courses. My master's thesis research was focused on characterizing a novel neuronal population within the thalamic reticular nucleus of the rodent brain. These neurons express a neuropeptide that commonly colocalizes with endocannabinoid receptors. My role in this research was everything from the breeding of the transgenic mice that express a fluorescent protein in this specific cell population, cardiac perfusion and brain removal, brain slicing and immunohistochemistry, to analysis using confocal microscopy and ImageJ. This research provided an example of the importance of foundational, basic research that can then be applied to the treatment of diseases and disorders. In this case, all psychiatric illnesses are correlated with dysfunction of the thalamic reticular nucleus.",https://www.linkedin.com/in/shayna-mallat

Utilizing this skill, I found my way into the customer/clientele service industry; restaurants, tour guiding, student advisor, various computer and network-based work, mechanic, electrician, legislative aide, landscaping, and English instructing. By using my skills in handling people/customers/clients I was able to learn a wide array of abilities from these past job experiences. From living and teaching English in Japan to jumping into the electrical trade, I found an avenue to combine both my love for IT, investigation, and critical thinking skills I learned through my electrical apprenticeship. In 2020 I founded and began building CIRI Hawaii LLC, CIRI standing for Commerical Infrared Inspections.

Over the past few years, I've shifted my focus to web technologies with a particular emphasis on front-end/client-side development, i.e. (X)HTML, CSS, and in particular have been shaping myself into somewhat of a Javascript guru. Having had a great deal of experience in the technical side of things such as coding with Delphi, SQL, HTML, CSS and Javascript (to name about 10% of the varied technlogies/languages I have experience with), as well as Business Analysis, Project and Product Management in the Retail, Supply Chain and Point of Sale sectors, there is one thing which truly triggers my interest nowadays: Pushing the boundaries of client-side Web Development and Javascript engineering. Without a robust, standards-compliant working knowledge of (X)HTML and CSS, much of Javascript's output would be invisible, but Javascript itself is very much underrated and misunderstood by a great number of developers. Understood and used properly, it is an elegant, robust, scalable and flexible language which has a lot of power. My aim with Javascript is to push things further, and ""spread-the-word"", so to speak, of the correct ways to develop in JS, and how to unleash its potential.

caleb-kirschman,Caleb Kirschman,"Cincinnati, Ohio, United States",US,,"My software career began in 2016 when an academic advisor told me it is easier to teach coding to a physicist than it is to teach a programmer physics. That was then nurtured by my research advisor for the next 3 years. Of course, it’s never easy practicing coding between physics classes and research, but with the right guidance, it can certainly be done. Shoutout to Dr. Nutter and Dr. Zacate who never let me take the easy way; I have been the better for it ever since. Not only does my unique foundation bring creative solutions to the industry, but also a discipline to ensure higher quality results. The practice often gets me labeled as an overachiever; however, I find doing a little extra work up front makes for less work overall. For example, as a DBA, I made it a habit to keep tabs on troublesome servers. Since naming conventions are not consistent, it was tedious keeping up with which server had what issue. But knowing the history of a server allowed me to combine past solutions into permanent resolutions. Once my team saw the results, I became one of our company’s preferred representatives for disaster-level recovery events within 6 months. But my DBA days are over (for now). I’m currently working as a Controls Software Engineer. I have learned a lot in the last decade and I believe that this job allows me to pool all my previous knowledge into a building block for my next challenge. From designing the architecture of new features to being hands on with machine diagnostics, there are many aspects of the process I must be familiar with. But I like a good puzzle, and balancing the demands of custom orders always brings something interesting through the door. Looking back, I am proud to say that I never backed down from a challenge. I am a self-motivated and self-made code monkey. I look forward with excitement for what I will accomplish next.",https://www.linkedin.com/in/caleb-kirschman
