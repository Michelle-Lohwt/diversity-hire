It represents a disruption of the consolidating influence of surface tension by the action of internal and external forces. Oil fired furnaces and boilers, diesel engines, and gas turbine utilize liquid fuel sprays in order to increase the fuel surface area and thus increase the vaporization and combustion rate.

In order to accurately assess and understand drop size data, all of the key variables such as nozzle type, pressure, capacity, liquid properties and spray angle have to be taken into consideration.
