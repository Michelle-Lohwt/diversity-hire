Ever since my childhood, I began my journey of leadership coach. Back then, I applied some amazing leadership skills to empower myself to become my best version and it didn’t stop there rather I helped my friends also, as I bring with me these Value to the group: • Creative problem solver • Great encourager and motivator • Convincing spokesperson • Negotiates conflicts by taking positive action Many of you may wonder why I worked on numerous domains - project management (PMO), .NET developer, Business process management specialist, Industry specialist and many other internal roles, all I have to say is – I didn’t wait for right opportunity I tried to build it and that helped me to embrace the discomfort and in this journey I learnt something which comes naturally to me is storytelling. What keeps me going in my journey is my attitude towards change which enabled me to embrace the discomfort, learn and grow. Enthusiastic, Influential, Expressive, Accepting and Sociable are my strengths and work style which also allows me to develop Empathy for my clients. My purpose of life is 3E’s – Explore, Experiment and Experience As you can see my journey has never been the same being from a PMO associate to a storytelling coach, I never stop exploring the opportunities around me which leads to lot of experiment adding up to my experience ( and finally I discovered my love for stories). Now with new normal I have step into personal branding, content creation, the space of podcasts, video making and social media marketing. I have delivered multiple workshops and talks in colleges as well as online events.

I know many “degreed” HR people who don’t have a clue about HR, and many ‘on-the-job’ trained HR people that stay abreast of the laws and regulations of the EEOC/ADA and Dept of Labor items that affect the workplace overall.To conclude, HRFraternity acts as a one-step resource centre for all HRD related support systems. At the back end, our team of seasoned professionals, and with sufficiently built in redundancy of skills, ensures you complete Business Process Continuity.Once you join with HRFraternity, we take care of your placement activities. We will be your placement consultants and you can just concentrate on your training & practice .Placement support with leading MNC & NON-MNC for placements. Top 30% performer will get 100% assured job offer or money back.Specialties: 1. LABOUR LAWS , STATUTORY COMPLIANCE & PAYROLL PROCESSING2. HR GENERALIST AREAS LIST3. CORE HR DOMAIN LIST4.

He was always available, he was local, and he built a trustworthy relationship with them. They could not say enough about Bob.

I am a self proclaimed Apple fan and have dabbled my hands in iOS and Mac app development during my initial years. Java is my heartbeat and I swear by it. Right from my school life in Kolkata, I have been actively working on various Java technologies and at the end of first year, I also did a training under IBM on various Java technologies and cloud computing. By second year, the hacking bug bit me mainly to access Wifi of restricted places with poor security. I did a course under ISOEH (Indian School of Ethical Hacking) under Ethical Hacking to further enhance my knowledge. In third year, I got an Internship in Amazon India and was put in the Supply Chain Optimisation Technologies (SCOT) team. My main job was to make a software to calculate the amount of influx of goods (using Machine Learning Techniques) and how much they needed to keep in their warehouses along with a robust notification service for the same. All the work basically involved Java. I also got exposed to Spring framework and due to rigorous testing procedures, I got familiar with almost all testing frameworks from Mockito, to PowerMock and EasyMock which is essential for robust software. I also got exposed to a lot of open source frameworks developed by Amazon and due to my satisfactory performance, I was offered a PPO (pre-placement offer) by Amazon India. In my final year of college, I was part of three research projects under Dr Mamata Dalui 1)Design of Coherence Solution for Clustered Cache Hierarchies 2)Design of Cache Eviction Policy for Last Level Cache Management 3)Graphical Interface for Viewing Explicit Rule Vector Graphs I am also a team player and am open to suggestions and insights from everyone.

Reliable, adaptable with attention to detail only matched by her professionalism. As Silvia’s line manager, I have had the pleasure to watch Silvia grow from a CAD Technician back in 2015 to an accomplished, well rounded architectural technician today. This has included not only gaining in-depth knowledge and experience in brand implementation, technical brand application and way-finding but also concept development in both 2D & 3D design. Very impressive in just a couple of years. Looking back, there are few people I can truly say that we had a fully mutual understanding, seamless work and collaboration understanding.

366,2022-12-13,shayna-mallat,Shayna Mallat,"Cambridge, Massachusetts, United States",US,,alnylam-pharmaceuticals,Alnylam Pharmaceuticals,Senior Associate Scientist in CNS at Alnylam Pharmaceuticals,,"Most recently I worked as a research associate within the Stanley Center for Psychiatric Research at the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard in Cambridge, MA. I am investigating molecular, cellular, and genetic changes that occur in schizophrenia. I received my master's degree at the University of New Hampshire in neuroscience where I became proficient at basic molecular biology techniques as well as the organization, perseverance, and attention to detail necessary to complete scientific experiments. I find every aspect of science exciting, whether it be sorting through the literature and brainstorming ideas, forming and refining experimental protocols, analyzing data, or interpreting and presenting results. In this regard, I value the team effort that is necessary for scientific advancement, but also feel very comfortable in an independent role. As a graduate student in neuroscience, I conducted independent research, managed a colony of transgenic mice, trained and supervised undergraduate students in the lab, and worked as a teaching assistant for both neuroscience and virology lab courses. My master's thesis research was focused on characterizing a novel neuronal population within the thalamic reticular nucleus of the rodent brain. These neurons express a neuropeptide that commonly colocalizes with endocannabinoid receptors. My role in this research was everything from the breeding of the transgenic mice that express a fluorescent protein in this specific cell population, cardiac perfusion and brain removal, brain slicing and immunohistochemistry, to analysis using confocal microscopy and ImageJ. This research provided an example of the importance of foundational, basic research that can then be applied to the treatment of diseases and disorders. In this case, all psychiatric illnesses are correlated with dysfunction of the thalamic reticular nucleus.","[{""attribution"":""Liked by Shayna Mallat"",""img"":""https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/C4E22AQEeLd0EkI9UmA/feedshare-shrink_800/0/1669478413452?e=2147483647&v=beta&t=mewvKJ6oq2sRgtqS-U-AfgBNIjea0jp94bYcqOdD8zE"",""link"":""https://www.linkedin.com/posts/nami_its-ok-to-set-boundaries-image-via-activity-7002299989515214848-jn2W"",""title"":""It's ok to set boundaries. - Image via selfloverainbow on IG""},{""attribution"":""Liked by Shayna Mallat"",""img"":""https://media-exp1.licdn.com/dms/image/D4D34AQFQxnVrpW8Blg/ugc-proxy-shrink_800/0/1669046545148?e=1671577200&v=beta&t=_CbtK4cdTAYHwxNDgD90CGGAeeA7nbsAC1uc24HaCjc"",""link"":""https://www.linkedin.com/posts/mclean-hospital_selena-gomez-opens-up-about-living-with-bipolar-activity-7000488594087809026-QWT9"",""title"":""“When you’re struggling with your mental health, the essential part of it is knowing what to do and recognizing that,” says Selena Gomez. “It’s…""},{""attribution"":""Liked by Shayna Mallat"",""img"":""https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/D4E05AQFwSVzc4rfi5A/videocover-low/0/1666894098112?e=2147483647&v=beta&t=D6Z8TzRDDE69kdJBsJ-b4-gqtBxhbNYD97A-Pt-MF4U"",""link"":""https://www.linkedin.com/posts/alnylam-pharmaceuticals_science-magazines-top-100-employers-for-activity-6991460628963991552-M3mw"",""title"":""We’re #AlnylamProud to be a Science Magazine #SCTopEmployer for the 4th consecutive year - this time ranked #2!

I've known her for almost ten years as a friend and in the last four years have gotten the opportunity to work with her too. She volunteered to run the art and craft and storytelling portion of our kids' classes at my bakery. She was very enthusiastic, responsible and put a lot of effort into crafting and executing all the classes even though she was helping out as a volunteer. Over the years I've known her, I've come to find that these qualities are carried over into all that she does, whether it's her official work or her volunteer and social causes that she champions. And on top of that, she has a big heart and a big laugh to go along with that!”,Caroline S. “The one thing that sets Peilin apart is her Passion. I had the pleasure of working with Peilin at MindShare Singapore on the Tiger Beer account in 2009/2010. It was a fast paced and demanding piece of business but Peilin’s passion drove her to approach it with enthusiasm, energy, creativity, brand love & excellence right down to the last detail. This, coupled with her strategic thinking ability, groundedness and the strong relationships she forged both with the client and partner agencies helped the team achieve success for the brand. Her passion and growth mindset puts her on a path of constant self improvement and it is inspiring to see how she is always learning, growing and achieving something new.

374,2023-01-13,jonahmolina,Jonah Molina,"Wailuku, Hawaii, United States",US,,,Infrared Inspections Hawaii,Certified Level 2 Thermographer & President of Infrared Inspections Hawaii,,"Originally starting out in the I.T. field, I discovered that the formal studies required to pursue a college education in I.T didn't appeal to me, so I change to Humanities. Through various courses and the socializing that it entailed I developed a particularly good skill in people-to-people interaction. Utilizing this skill, I found my way into the customer/clientele service industry; restaurants, tour guiding, student advisor, various computer and network-based work, mechanic, electrician, legislative aide, landscaping, and English instructing. By using my skills in handling people/customers/clients I was able to learn a wide array of abilities from these past job experiences. From living and teaching English in Japan to jumping into the electrical trade, I found an avenue to combine both my love for IT, investigation, and critical thinking skills I learned through my electrical apprenticeship. In 2020 I founded and began building CIRI Hawaii LLC, CIRI standing for Commerical Infrared Inspections. We provide electrical, mechanical, roof, building envelope, and energy audit infrared surveys for commercial facilities small and large. Not only is it our mission to serve all of Hawaii's facilities, but also to facilitate relationships with all those we come into contact with. Business is about relationships and being in Hawaii makes that statement more so. We are a Hawaii-born, raised, founded, and operated business and bring that aloha every day.","[{""attribution"":""Liked by Jonah Molina"",""img"":""https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/C5622AQEPD72_XVHzPA/feedshare-shrink_2048_1536/0/1673381283261?e=2147483647&v=beta&t=rg5UY0FRbH2EbU26AQuMWX4b95NEBAeBiRtCsI-dXzI"",""link"":""https://www.linkedin.com/posts/patricia-stricker-57343464_for-those-packing-their-bags-for-irinfo-activity-7018669815091388416-8BPW"",""title"":""For those packing their bags for IR/INFO this weekend.... don't forget your challenge coins....

I am interested in telling the stories of family structure and relationships. I find each family unique in their own way, and yet, they are all going through the same everyday hardships. A majority of my story work has been by reference from past story participants creating a unique relationship between all of their stories. I thrive working with people doing extraordinary things on an everyday basis, and I am always interested in exploring new places. I am interested in still photography, videography, picture editing, and social media.","[{""attribution"":""Liked by Ellen O'Neill"",""img"":""https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/C4E22AQF9IAquvI-zLQ/feedshare-shrink_2048_1536/0/1673440239610?e=2147483647&v=beta&t=X9RYYy3HWVyN3luTvf4YoLxDfvs-4Xkphs6u4tR2M1g"",""link"":""https://www.linkedin.com/posts/the-new-yorker_newyorkercartoons-activity-7018917094658293761-MbTK"",""title"":""A cartoon by Sam Hurt. #NewYorkerCartoons See more from this week’s issue: http://nyer.cm/LoWY7ht""},{""attribution"":""Liked by Ellen O'Neill"",""img"":""https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/C4D22AQH5oJAYRkt3Qw/feedshare-shrink_2048_1536/0/1673360782147?e=2147483647&v=beta&t=yBw5wmoB-Qb-T7eS2XOP6oRl0p_cFpcZ0zym2hz9EnM"",""link"":""https://www.linkedin.com/posts/the-new-yorker_newyorkercartoons-activity-7018583825509232640-ZMvb"",""title"":""A cartoon by Ellie Black. #NewYorkerCartoons See more from this week’s issue: http://nyer.cm/u31VKtm""},{""attribution"":""Liked by Ellen O'Neill"",""img"":""https://static.licdn.com/sc/h/51xdp0u9qm8nhegwpxoxgd0mb"",""link"":""https://www.linkedin.com/posts/jason-baker-64b71799_talentacquisition-youngprofessionals-experience-activity-7016103053510524928-Uxcw"",""title"":""Nebraska Department of Health and Human Services has an opening for an Onboarding Specialist.

567,2023-03-01,paulsoftware,Paul Graham,"Montmorency, Victoria, Australia",AU,OC,ask4software-limited,Ask4Software Limited,Senior Full Stack Javascript Developer at TraceComms,,"I have over 16 years experience in a vast number of areas within the Software Development industry. Over the past few years, I've shifted my focus to web technologies with a particular emphasis on front-end/client-side development, i.e. (X)HTML, CSS, and in particular have been shaping myself into somewhat of a Javascript guru. Having had a great deal of experience in the technical side of things such as coding with Delphi, SQL, HTML, CSS and Javascript (to name about 10% of the varied technlogies/languages I have experience with), as well as Business Analysis, Project and Product Management in the Retail, Supply Chain and Point of Sale sectors, there is one thing which truly triggers my interest nowadays: Pushing the boundaries of client-side Web Development and Javascript engineering. Without a robust, standards-compliant working knowledge of (X)HTML and CSS, much of Javascript's output would be invisible, but Javascript itself is very much underrated and misunderstood by a great number of developers. Understood and used properly, it is an elegant, robust, scalable and flexible language which has a lot of power. My aim with Javascript is to push things further, and ""spread-the-word"", so to speak, of the correct ways to develop in JS, and how to unleash its potential.

I am Todd Jackman, a fellow IT Professional. I have 13 years of experience working in Information Technology. Brian is one individual who I have worked with who uniquely stands out. During our time together, Brian displayed great talents as an IT Manager and System Administrator. When first started working with Brian, I was immediately impressed, but during the time worked together, his work ethic and knowledge was phenomenal. Any time I needed Brian’s assistance, he didn’t simply email me a ‘how to…’ document, he assisted and ensure not only the issue was resolved, he helped me learn from the issue and how to mitigate these issues again. He would not leave my side either virtually or in person, until my problem was solved. He was like this for everyone! It’s not just his technical skills that impress me, however. Brian was a joy to work for because of his amazingly positive attitude and respectfulness. His sense of responsibility as well as work ethic is a rare and wonderful thing to observe. I am absolutely confident that Brian would be a great fit for any company. Not only will he bring the kind of skills and experiences you’re looking for in an applicant, he will quickly become an asset and help your company grow in any way he can. If you need more information or specific examples, please do not hesitate to contact me at todd.jackman@outlook.com. As a recommendation letter really only provides a snapshot of his talents and achievements, I would be happy to further elaborate on my time working with him. Sincerely, Todd Jackman ”,Brendon Chappell “I worked closely with Brian for over 10 years and had the pleasure of managing Brian in his System Administrator and IT Supervisor roles. Over the years, Brian has continuously taken on greater responsibilities and risen with every challenge. Not only is Brian highly intelligent with great technical skills; he also is very hard-working and brings an infectious positive attitude to the team. He has tackled every project assigned to him with enthusiasm, competence and with minimal supervision. Brian has been an essential and trusted employee, one that any organization would be fortunate to employ. I highly recommend Brian for employment and am positive he would make a great asset to any organization.”",3.0,,

This is the main reason to study for my Telecommunication Engineering Degree where I improved my knowledge in this field. Moreover, I also enjoy Cryptography and Networks, the basis of Cybersecurity. I love to use my skills to help critical infrastructure (Finance, Telecommunications, Defense/Military, Aerospace, Pharmaceutical...) meet their high standards for Cybersecurity. My technical skills range from successfully conducting a Pentest to Network Traffic Analysis, Vulnerability Assessment, Threat Hunting and performing high-quality wired and wireless attacks, as well as offering Mitigation Strategies for these attacks (Blue Team) for Security Operations Center (SOC) roles. I also have deep knowledge of Identity and Access Management (IAM) and Azure Cloud. Moreover, I am an experienced programmer in Python and JavaScript. On top of that, I have strong reporting skills and Soft Skills for client-based jobs, as well as Time and Project Management skills and Leadership. I see myself as a proactive, disciplined, constant individual who does not give up in the face of any problem.

He is so friendly and he works incredibly hard to ensure that you are placed in the best roles suited to your individual skills, experience and personality. Unlike other recruiters it doesn't stop there with Matt; he checks you have all the information you need before you start the role, checks in with you regularly during the placement to see how it's going and to ask if you need any guidance or help with anything, and if it's a short term role he will check in afterwards to make sure everything went well. Matt is a true professional who clearly takes great pride in his work and genuinely cares that you are placed in roles that you will excel in and enjoy. He is also incredibly quick to respond to queries, often within a couple of minutes. I couldn't recommend him highly enough. ”",2.0,,

I have also just worked as a missionary for two years in fostering a new church and it's community for the Seventh Day Adventist Church of Ghana in Bole-Mandare. I participated in developing and administering questionnaire to build effective structures for nursery operation in Cocobod-Ched Ghana in Berekum. Within a period of 10 months I work as an extensionist in 15 communities to change the feeling of indifference by farmers toward Ched Berekum through regular farm visit, intensified farm measurement, rigorous group formation and strengthening, timely farm inspection, phone call extension services, efficient and equitable distribution of chemical inputs and fertilizer to farmers and strengthening social tides with farmers.

When I went into the sessions I had a personal topic that occupied me but I had only a rough idea of what I wanted to get out of the sessions. Thanks to Sandra’s ability to be fully present and create a safe and supportive environment, to focus completely on what I said hearing also the underlying meaning and reflect it back to me, her genuine interest in my themes and her flexibility to deal with whatever I came up with and ask powerful questions that made me think, I was able to gain much clarity around the topic that had occupied me so much. Excessively so I was even able to complete several major activities that helped me to free myself from limiting beliefs and unfold my potential. Sandra was always well prepared for our sessions and gave me the space I needed to “sort my thoughts”. She frequently acknowledged my endeavors and progresses and I enjoyed the sessions with her very much. I can wholeheartedly recommend her as a coach. Silvia Richter-Kaupp”,Pamela Rudisill, CPC, GCC “Sandra is a truly gifted coach! Her kind and compassion nature instills trust, allowing for the freedom to explore your ideas and beliefs. She will listen with great care and help you gain the insight and perspective necessary to create lasting change. I highly recommend Sandra if you are looking for an effective professional coach to help you reach your goals and live your best life!”",6.0,,

Morten here, I am an outgoing, energetic and creative soul who has years of experience behind me in various industries. Regardless of the industry, I have always had my MOTTO top of mind: You get what you give! The motto has given me a lot of joy, at work as well as privately. If we all start our communication at zero, with the text: ""You're ok, I'm ok"", whether we are Directors or Laundry Helpers - we get synergies that are absolutely essential for joint happiness and success. For approx. a year ago I discovered AI - Digital art, and I have been hooked on this field ever since. Got good press coverage and now have a contract with an agent company in Paris, France. Is there anything I can help with? Send an inmail or txt me. Have a wonderful day ahead, and remember to live 100%!

832,2023-01-13,caleb-kirschman,Caleb Kirschman,"Cincinnati, Ohio, United States",US,,milacron,Milacron,Controls Software Engineer,,"My software career began in 2016 when an academic advisor told me it is easier to teach coding to a physicist than it is to teach a programmer physics. That was then nurtured by my research advisor for the next 3 years. Of course, it’s never easy practicing coding between physics classes and research, but with the right guidance, it can certainly be done. Shoutout to Dr. Nutter and Dr. Zacate who never let me take the easy way; I have been the better for it ever since. Not only does my unique foundation bring creative solutions to the industry, but also a discipline to ensure higher quality results. The practice often gets me labeled as an overachiever; however, I find doing a little extra work up front makes for less work overall. For example, as a DBA, I made it a habit to keep tabs on troublesome servers. Since naming conventions are not consistent, it was tedious keeping up with which server had what issue. But knowing the history of a server allowed me to combine past solutions into permanent resolutions. Once my team saw the results, I became one of our company’s preferred representatives for disaster-level recovery events within 6 months. But my DBA days are over (for now). I’m currently working as a Controls Software Engineer. I have learned a lot in the last decade and I believe that this job allows me to pool all my previous knowledge into a building block for my next challenge. From designing the architecture of new features to being hands on with machine diagnostics, there are many aspects of the process I must be familiar with. But I like a good puzzle, and balancing the demands of custom orders always brings something interesting through the door. Looking back, I am proud to say that I never backed down from a challenge. I am a self-motivated and self-made code monkey.

He quickly understands a business need, figures out the best technical solution, and can build practically anything that is easy for business users to use and seamlessly integrates with existing databases and analytics. He also excels at quantitative and analytical challenges and opportunities. He owned our Tableau business intelligence initiative and built out our first Tableau analytics. Additionally, he quickly became my right hand even though I had three others on the team. I did most of my brainstorming with him, and relied on him for his creativity, exceptional problem-solving skills, good judgment, honesty, and calm demeanor. It was a hectic and demanding job with changing priorities and many emergencies. Dan kept me and the whole team calm and focused on what we needed to do.

Evan has had a very good development within the company thanks to his drive, intelligence, professional approach and extroverted ability. Evan is very much appreciated by all collaborators throughout the company and it has been a pleasure working with Evan. I can give him my warmest recommendations for similar roles.”,Ginger Lohman “Evan is an absolutely fantastic trainer!!! I recently attended one of Evan’s 3 day training events. As a new hire transitioning between industries I was worried about getting up to speed quickly. Evan’s training style is diverse and engaging. His approach provides an excellent balance of lecture, interactive coursework, application examples, and hands-on exercises. Evan is very good at reading his audience and provides content that is challenging, without leaving the room behind.

Piotr wykazał się dużą elastycznością, empatią i ""ludzkim podejściem"" i krok po kroku pomógł mi wyjść z impasu i rozwinąć się według najoptymistyczniejszych scenariuszy. Piotr pozostając otwartym na moje własne cele, potrafił równocześnie skutecznie egzekwować ich realizację. Współpraca z Piotrem przynosi pozytywne i długofalowe efekty. ”,Catarzyna Janusz “Z niecierpliwością każdorazowo czekam na spotkania z Piotrem. Po odbytej sesji jestem zmotywowana do pracy nad sobą i chciałabym więcej od zaraz. Piotr zwrócił mi uwagę na rzeczy, których wcześniej nie widziałam. Nie zauważałam. Trudne do uwierzenia, ale to niesamowite ile może dać konstruktywna rozmowa. Odkryłam wiele zaskakujących rzeczy o sobie, zespole. Zrozumiałam skąd biorą się przeszkody i jak znaleźć klucz do ich rozwiązania. I co najważniejsze – powoli i skutecznie osiągam swój zamierzony cel. Współpraca z Piotrem to przyjemność. Polecam każdemu kto poszukuje pomysłu na siebie, właściwej drogi. Dziękuję Piotr.”",4.0,,

I've had the privileged of working with amazing clients in real estate for 5+ years. Going with Keller Williams and the Chattahoochee North office in Peachtree Corners was the best decision I have ever made. I just finished off my best year yet with 6 Million in closed volume. I have been on the agent leadership council (ALC) at my office as well as being a mentor and productivity coach. I have my SRS (seller's representative specialist) and ABR (accredited Buyer's Representative) designations. Through these 5 years I have worked with an assortment of buyers and sellers and there is no age and stage that I won't serve well. My clients value my diligence, hard work, negotiating skills and knowledge. Before getting into real estate I worked in Gwinnett County Schools as a high school Chemistry teacher for 11 years. I was successful for 11 years with selling my students on my classroom setup, ideas on learning and their need to have a solid education. I educated students on how to learn and how to believe in themselves. The greatest compliment ever was said by a former student: ""Mr McCoy you made me believe that I was good at science"".

Then, I plunge into the practical things that you need to consider before installing an RTLS and the common pitfalls that you need to be aware of. I include a chapter on evaluating an RTLS solution or selecting an RTLS vendor. And because RTLS security is equally as important as its accuracy, I also include a chapter on possible RTLS hacks and attacks. After reading this book, you’ll know what an RTLS is, how an RTLS is achieved, how to choose the right RTLS technology, and how you can make an RTLS work for you. Like other For Dummies books, this one’s been designed to let you skip around as much as possible. If you don’t want to read this book cover to cover, you don’t have to. Your current knowledge or experience of an RTLS makes some topics more relevant than others. If you want to zero-in on a particular topic, you can use the Table of Contents and index to focus on that coverage.

It has presented significant challenges, satisfying successes, frustrating failures, incredible learning, great friendships and above all else it has provided fulfilment and enjoyment.Along my personal journey I have acquired over twenty five years of professional learning and experience in leadership, management, business development, change management, cultural change, people development and a strong systems perspective. This has left me fully equipped for making solid and meaningful impact when improving business performance.I would describe myself as a highly experienced leader and coach responsible for enabling individuals and organisations with the knowledge and confidence to realise real transformational change. My experience has taught me this is best achieved by focusing on the principles and purpose behind what we do, the why, and not just how we do it. The result is an environment where people feel emotionally safe and able to challenge the status quo, where they can leverage their abilities to solve problems and think creatively about their daily work.My approach is influenced by both my practical experiences and many thought leaders whose thinking is reflected in The Shingo Model for Enterprise Excellence. I have worked in depth with the Enterprise Excellence and the Shingo Model after leading the team that successfully launched The Shingo Prize in the UK and Europe in 2008. As a result I have been able to guide many organisations by helping them implement the changes that are conveyed by a principle based approach to excellence, which has included many Shingo recognition and Prize winning sites.","[{""attribuion"":""Liked by Adam Buckley M.A."",""title"":""""},{""attribuion"":""Liked by Adam Buckley M.A."",""title"":""""},{""attribuion"":""Liked by Adam Buckley M.A."",""title"":""""}]","[{""img"":null,""subtitle"":""-"",""title"":""Operational Excellence""},{""img"":null,""subtitle"":""-"",""title"":""Lean Six Sigma""},{""img"":null,""subtitle"":""-"",""title"":""systems thinking network""},{""img"":null,""subtitle"":""-"",""title"":""Leadership, Transformation and Change Forum""},{""img"":null,""subtitle"":""-"",""title"":""Shingo Prize™ - Shingo Institute - Evolving Cultures Toward Excellence""},{""img"":null,""subtitle"":""-"",""title"":""Gemba Academy""},{""img"":null,""subtitle"":""-"",""title"":""Business Improvement, Change Management, Corporate Culture & Performance Management""},{""img"":null,""subtitle"":""-"",""title"":""PEX Network | Insight and Inspiration for Process Professionals""},{""img"":null,""subtitle"":""-"",""title"":""Strategy Execution Community""},{""img"":null,""subtitle"":""-"",""title"":""Harvard Business Review Discussion Group""}]","{""company_id"":""the-manufacturing-institute"",""industry"":""Education Management"",""link"":""https://www.linkedin.com/company/the-manufacturing-institute"",""name"":""The Manufacturing Institute""}","[{""company"":""The Manufacturing Institute"",""company_id"":""the-manufacturing-institute"",""industry"":""Education Management"",""location"":""Manchester, United Kingdom"",""positions"":[{""description"":"""",""duration"":""Jan 2018 - Present 3 years 5 months"",""duration_short"":""3 years 5 months"",""end_date"":""Present"",""start_date"":""Jan 2018"",""subtitle"":""The Manufacturing Institute"",""title"":""Leadership & Enterprise Excellence Coach""}],""url"":""https://www.linkedin.com/company/the-manufacturing-institute""},{""company"":""Excellence Through Design Ltd"",""company_id"":""excellence-through-design"",""location"":""Luddenden, United Kingdom"",""positions"":[{""description"":""Excellence is never an accident, it is the result of deliberate intention, genuine effort, intelligent direction and skillful execution, achieving Excellence through Design.There are four key inputs required to drive transformation and sustain excellence throughout an organisation.

We are never too busy to listen, too tired to care, or too proud to laugh at ourselves.
